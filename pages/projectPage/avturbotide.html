                            <h4><strong>pH Sensor:</strong></h4><p>Monitors water acidity/alkalinity, a crucial factor for maintaining a healthy aquatic ecosystem.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h4><strong>Turbidity Sensor:</strong></h4><p> Detects the presence of suspended particles, indicating potential pollution or erosion.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h4><strong>Dissolved Oxygen Sensor:</strong></h4><p>Measures oxygen levels, vital for fish survival and microbial activity.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h4><strong>TDS Sensor:</strong></h4><p>Quantifies total dissolved solids, highlighting potential contaminants.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h4><strong>Temperature Sensor:</strong></h4><p>Tracks water temperature, which impacts oxygen solubility and pollutant behavior.</p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>This data-gathering marvel is powered by an Arduino Mega microcontroller and transmits sensor data wirelessly. The information feeds into a user-friendly website accessible from any device. Additionally, a convenient QR code displayed on the boat allows anyone to scan and instantly view the water quality status.</p><br>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <h4><strong>Module 2: The Cleanup Boat (Pollution Fighter):</strong></h4><p>While Module 1 gathers vital intel, Module 2 takes decisive action. This secondary boat springs into action when predefined pollution thresholds, detected by Module 1, are reached. Depending on the specific contaminants identified, targeted cleanup strategies are deployed. Here are some potential methods:</p>
                </li>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <h4><strong>Bioremediation:</strong></h4><p>Nature's superheroes! Utilizing bacteria or algae to naturally break down pollutants.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4><strong>Sorption</strong></h4><p>Employing absorbent materials like charcoal or zeolites to trap contaminants.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4><strong>Mechanical Filtration:</strong></h4><p>Removing suspended particles and debris through physical filtration systems.</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </ul>

            <h3><strong>Phase 2: The Power of AI and ML</strong></h3>
